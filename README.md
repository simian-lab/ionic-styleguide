Ionic Styleguide
================

Hi there! this is an Ionic Framework module that creates a simple style guide for your product. This will make it easier to see all your design elements in one place so you can customize them easily.

#Cool, so how does it work?
Glad you asked. Basically, you just need to do three simple steps:

1. Install `ionic-styleguide`. Just run `bower install ionic-styleguide`.
2. Add a call to `ionic-styleguide.js` in your HTML.
3. Add `ionic-styleguide` to your dependencies (ie. `angular.module('myApp', ['ionic', 'ionic-styleguide', ...]))`.

That's it! your style guide should be accesible at /styleguide â€“ie. if you're testing at `http://localhost:8100`, your styleguide should be at `http://localhost:8100/#/styleguide`.

#Nice... so how do I change these styles?
Great question. If you haven't already, take a look at this great doc:
http://ionicframework.com/tutorials/customizing-ionic-with-sass/.

When you change your styles, they will automatically show on your style guide. Enjoy!
